# pqcrypto.js

This is a suite of quantum-resistant cryptographic libraries for JavaScript/WebAssembly,
along with a few related utilities. Most of the algorithms included are products of the
[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography)
competition.
